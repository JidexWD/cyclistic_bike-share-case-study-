  You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago.

Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
