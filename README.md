## Project Overview 
  You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

  - Data Transfromation
    
    jupyter note book is used to perform the data transformation because we are using python to analyse this dataset 
    python gives us a lot of flexibility when handling data

## Results 
  the reults of the analysis  shows 
  - the members have a higher activity rate from the 7am to 9pm 
  - but in the case of rides more causals riders makes trips on everyday of the weeek than the members
  -  wednesdays and thursdays are the days with the most bike trips by casuals
  -  saturdays and sunday is the time when members make the most bike trips
## Recommendations 
  - Target casual riders with promotions for weekday rides: Incentivize weekday usage to increase casual         rider engagement.
  - Offer trial memberships: A limited-time offer for casual riders to experience member benefits may             encourage them to convert to annual members.
  - Digital media campaigns: Use social media and targeted ads focusing on convenience, flexibility, and cost savings to appeal to casual riders.
